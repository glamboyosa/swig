# Advanced Concepts

## Transactional Integrity

In distributed systems, especially job queues, transactional integrity is crucial. Swig offers three levels of transaction control:

### 1. Bring Your Own Transaction (Recommended)

Use your existing database transaction for maximum control:

```go
tx, _ := pool.Begin(ctx)
defer tx.Rollback(ctx)

// Create user
userID := createUser(tx)

// Enqueue welcome email in same transaction
err := swigClient.AddJobWithTx(ctx, tx, &EmailWorker{
    To: email,
    Subject: "Welcome!",
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}
return tx.Commit(ctx)
```

### 2. Use Swig's Transaction Helper

Let Swig manage the transaction for you:

```go
err := swigClient.driver.WithTx(ctx, func(tx Transaction) error {
    // Create user
    if err := createUser(tx); err != nil {
        return err // Triggers rollback
    }
    
    // Add job (auto rollback if this fails)
    return tx.Exec(ctx, insertJobSQL, ...)
})
```

### 3. No Transaction (Simple)

For simple, non-transactional job enqueueing:

```go
err := swigClient.AddJob(ctx, &EmailWorker{
    To: email,
    Subject: "Welcome!",
})
```

## Benefits of Transactional Job Processing

- **No Lost Jobs**: Jobs are either fully committed or not at all
- **Atomic Processing**: Jobs are processed exactly once using PostgreSQL's SKIP LOCK
- **Data Consistency**: Jobs can be part of your application's transactions

## Architecture

Swig uses PostgreSQL's advanced features for efficient job distribution:

### SKIP LOCK for Job Distribution

Swig uses PostgreSQL's SKIP LOCK feature to ensure:
- No duplicate job processing
- Fair job distribution across workers
- High availability
- Transactional integrity

### Leader Election

Built-in leader election using PostgreSQL advisory locks ensures:
- Only one worker processes jobs at a time
- Automatic failover if the leader fails
- No external coordination needed

## Batch Processing

Swig supports efficient batch insertion of multiple jobs:

### Basic Batch Insertion

```go
batchJobs := []drivers.BatchJob{
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{
            To: "batch1@example.com",
            Subject: "Batch Welcome",
            Body: "Welcome to our platform!",
        },
        Opts: drivers.JobOptions{
            Queue: "default",
            Priority: 1,
            RunAt: time.Now(),
        },
    },
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{
            To: "batch2@example.com",
            Subject: "Batch Welcome",
            Body: "Welcome to our platform!",
        },
        Opts: drivers.JobOptions{
            Queue: "default",
            Priority: 1,
            RunAt: time.Now(),
        },
    },
}

err := swigClient.AddJobs(ctx, batchJobs)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to add batch jobs: %v", err)
} else {
    log.Println("Batch jobs added successfully")
}
```

### Transactional Batch Insertion

```go
tx, err := db.Begin()
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to begin transaction: %v", err)
    return
}
defer tx.Rollback()

txBatchJobs := []drivers.BatchJob{
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{
            To: "tx1@example.com",
            Subject: "Transactional Welcome",
            Body: "Welcome to our platform!",
        },
        Opts: drivers.JobOptions{
            Queue: "default",
            Priority: 1,
            RunAt: time.Now(),
        },
    },
    {
        Worker: &EmailWorker{
            To: "tx2@example.com",
            Subject: "Transactional Welcome",
            Body: "Welcome to our platform!",
        },
        Opts: drivers.JobOptions{
            Queue: "default",
            Priority: 1,
            RunAt: time.Now(),
        },
    },
}

log.Println("Adding transactional batch jobs...")
if err := swigClient.AddJobsWithTx(ctx, tx, txBatchJobs); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to add transactional batch jobs: %v", err)
    return
}

if err := tx.Commit(); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to commit transaction: %v", err)
    return
}
log.Println("Transactional batch jobs added successfully")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing

- Batch insertion is significantly faster than individual inserts
- Optimal batch size depends on your database configuration
- Monitor memory usage for large batches

### Driver Selection

Swig supports two PostgreSQL drivers with different characteristics:

1. **pgx Driver** (Recommended)
   - Better performance
   - Native LISTEN/NOTIFY support
   - Real-time job notifications
   - Optimized for batch operations

2. **database/sql Driver**
   - Standard Go database interface
   - Requires `github.com/lib/pq` for LISTEN/NOTIFY
   - Simpler implementation
   - Good for most use cases

## Cleanup and Testing

Swig provides methods for both graceful shutdown and complete cleanup:

```go
// Graceful shutdown: Wait for jobs to complete
err := swigClient.Stop(ctx)

// Complete cleanup: Drop all Swig tables
err := swigClient.Close(ctx)
```

The `Close` method is particularly useful in:
- Testing environments
- Development scenarios
- CI/CD pipelines
