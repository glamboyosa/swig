# Swig

> Job queues as refreshing as taking a swig üç∫

Swig is a robust, PostgreSQL-backed job queue system for Go applications, designed for developers who need reliable background job processing with minimal setup.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Alpha Status**: Swig is currently in alpha and actively being developed towards v1.0.0. The API may undergo changes during this phase. For stability in production environments, we strongly recommend pinning to a specific version:

```bash
go get github.com/glamboyosa/swig@v0.1.15-alpha
```

## Features

- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Built on top of PostgreSQL for reliability and scalability
- **Go-First Design**: Native Go implementation with idiomatic patterns
- **Simple API**: Easy to use with minimal boilerplate
- **Distributed Processing**: Run multiple workers across different machines
- **Transaction Support**: Integrate with your existing database transactions
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently add multiple jobs in a single operation

## Why PostgreSQL?

Swig leverages PostgreSQL's powerful features to provide a robust job queue solution:

- **Self-Hosted**: No external services required - just your existing PostgreSQL database
- **Transactional Guarantees**: Jobs are processed exactly once with ACID compliance
- **Built-in Queue Management**: Uses PostgreSQL's SKIP LOCK for efficient job distribution
- **Leader Election**: Automatic leader election using PostgreSQL advisory locks
- **Real-time Notifications**: Native LISTEN/NOTIFY support for immediate job processing
- **Scalability**: Process jobs across multiple machines without external coordination

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
    "github.com/glamboyosa/swig/drivers"
    import swig "github.com/glamboyosa/swig"
)

// 1. Define your worker
type EmailWorker struct {
    To      string `json:"to"`
    Subject string `json:"subject"`
    Body    string `json:"body"`
}

func (w *EmailWorker) JobName() string {
    return "send_email"
}

func (w *EmailWorker) Process(ctx context.Context) error {
    return sendEmail(w.To, w.Subject, w.Body)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()

    // Setup database connection (choose one)
    
    // Option A: Using pgx
    pgxConfig, _ := pgxpool.ParseConfig("postgres://localhost:5432/myapp")
    pgxPool, _ := pgxpool.NewWithConfig(ctx, pgxConfig)
    driver, _ := drivers.NewPgxDriver(pgxPool)
    
    // Option B: Using database/sql
    // db, _ := sql.Open("postgres", "postgres://localhost:5432/myapp")
    // driver, _ := drivers.NewSQLDriver(db, connString)
    
    // Create a worker registry and register your workers
    workers := swig.NewWorkerRegistry()
    workers.RegisterWorker(&EmailWorker{})
    
    // Configure queues (default setup)
    configs := []swig.SwigQueueConfig{
        {QueueType: swig.Default, MaxWorkers: 5},
    }
    
    // Create and start Swig with worker registry
    swigClient := swig.NewSwig(driver, configs, workers)
    swigClient.Start(ctx)
    
    // Add a job (uses default queue)
    err := swigClient.AddJob(ctx, &EmailWorker{
        To:      "user@example.com",
        Subject: "Welcome!",
        Body:    "Hello from Swig",
    })
}
```

## Why Swig?

Swig was created to provide a reliable, PostgreSQL-based job queue for Go applications. It leverages PostgreSQL's robust transaction support and durability guarantees to ensure your jobs are processed reliably.

Built by [Timothy Ogbemudia](https://glamboyosa.xyz) (glamboyosa), Swig combines the power of PostgreSQL with Go's simplicity to deliver a robust job queue solution.
